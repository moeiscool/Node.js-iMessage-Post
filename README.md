`cd directory/where/you/got/the/goods`

get dependencies `npm install imailer express`

then run `node imessage.js`

you may keep the process alive with `pm2 start imessage.js` if you already have it.

if not you can do so by running `npm install pm2 -g`

the script will then allow you to POST from web page to send iMessage or SMS through imailer

`imailer is not made by me.`
